# gas-bad
A collection of tips and tricks for better EVM gas utilization from all around the space. Consider adding to it via PRs, tysm.

# structure
Instead of just waving numbers and code snippets, this is set up as a Foundry project with A/B[...] tests, which you can tinker with.

`A` is the straightforward `gas-bad` option, `B` is the `gas-better` option, `C` is the `gas-even-better` option, and so on. 

Each case study is implemented as a separate set of contracts with its own set of tests and its own `REAMDE` for the explanation.
